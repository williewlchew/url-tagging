# You can use this script to launch Redis and RabbitMQ on Kubernetes
# and forward their connections to your local computer. That means
# you can then work on your worker-server.py and rest-server.py
# on your local computer rather than pushing to Kubernetes with each change.
#
# To kill the port-forward processes us e.g. "ps augxww | grep port-forward"
# to identify the processes ids
